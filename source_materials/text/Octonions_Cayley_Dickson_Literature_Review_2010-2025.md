Abstract:
  Surveys recent progress in the search for an appropriate internal space
  algebra for the Standard Model. Uses Clifford algebras involving operators
  of left multiplication by octonions, with a central role played by a complex
  structure implementing the splitting O = C + C^3 reflecting the lepton-quark
  symmetry.

Mathematical Framework:
  - Uses Clifford algebras Cl_10
  - Employs complex structure generated by volume forms
  - Introduces Z_2-graded internal space algebra
  - Projects tensor products to represent particle interactions
  - Complex structure splits octonions: O = C + C^3

Physical Predictions:
  - Relates Higgs and W-boson masses through "theoretical Weinberg angle"
  - Preserves color symmetry through specific algebraic projections
  - Provides algebraic approach to understanding particle physics structure

Advantages:
  - Natural incorporation of lepton-quark symmetry
  - Elegant mathematical structure using division algebras
  - Connects Standard Model gauge groups to octonion automorphisms

Connections to Quantum Gravity:
  - Framework potentially extends to include gravity through exceptional groups

Abstract:
  Explores a "somewhat mysterious appearance of SU_c(3) representations" that
  model three generations of standard model particles using complex octonions.
  The Clifford algebra Cl(6) derived from complex octonions partitions the
  64-dimensional space into six triplets, six singlets, and their antiparticles,
  mirroring the chromodynamic structure of exactly three generations of the
  standard model's fermions.

Mathematical Framework:
  - Uses Clifford algebra Cl(6) from complex octonions
  - 64-complex-dimensional space

  - Produces correct electric charges and attributes for single generation

Authors:
  Alessio Marrani, Michael Rios, David Chester

Abstract:
  Proposes extending the Standard Model based on the conjecture that symmetries
  of microscopic forces originate from automorphism groups of Cayley-Dickson
  algebras (from complex numbers to octonions and sedenions). Leads to an
  enlargement of the Standard Model color sector from SU(3) to an exceptional
  Higgs-broken G(2) group.

Mathematical Framework:
  - Cayley-Dickson Construction Chain:
    R (1D) -> C (2D) -> H (4D) -> O (8D) -> S (16D - sedenions)

  - Automorphism Groups:
    C: U(1) -> electromagnetism
    H: SU(2) -> weak force
    O: G2 -> proposed extension
    S: Continues pattern to sedenions

  - Properties Lost at Each Step:
    After C: commutativity
    After H: associativity
    After O: alternativity

Physical Predictions:
  - G(2) enlargement of SU(3) color symmetry
  - Addresses dark matter problem
  - Once broken (Higgs-like mechanism), G(2) describes:
    * Strong interaction
    * Dark matter sector simultaneously

  - No new physics expected beyond sedenions
  - Sedenions represent boundary of physically relevant algebras

Advantages:
  - Provides dark matter candidate
  - Unifies strong force with new physics
  - Natural termination at sedenions (simplicity criterion)
  - Systematic extension of Standard Model

Connections to String Theory:
  - Exceptional groups appear in heterotic string theory
  - E8 breaking: E8 -> SU(3) x E6
  - G2 as subgroup of exceptional hierarchy

Experimental Tests:
  - Search for G(2) gauge bosons at colliders
  - Dark matter detection experiments
  - Deviations from SU(3) at high energies
  - New particle states from broken G(2) symmetry

Abstract:
  Proposes a unified field theory based on the E8 Lie group that combines
  particle physics with Einstein's theory of gravitation using the largest
  simple exceptional Lie algebra, E8 (248 dimensions).

  - 2009 Distler & Garibaldi: Proved impossible to embed three fermion
    generations in E8
  - Cannot work as complete theory in current form
  - Active research continues on modified versions

   Status: TESTING QUANTUM NATURE, NOT DIVISION ALGEBRA STRUCTURE

   Findings:
   - Experiments focus on whether gravity is quantum vs. classical
   - No tests of non-associative gravity theories
   - No tests of octonionic gravity formulations
   - Planck-scale physics remains experimentally inaccessible

4. MODIFIED NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS (MOND):
   Status: OBSERVATIONAL SUPPORT, BUT NOT UNIQUE TO JORDAN ALGEBRA

   Findings:
   - Galactic rotation curves show MOND-like behavior
   - Singh (2023) claims Jordan algebra predicts MOND
   - However, MOND itself controversial and has alternative explanations
   - Not unique test of Jordan algebra approach
   - Dark matter models also explain observations

5. CASIMIR EFFECT AND QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT:
   Status: EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED, NO DIVISION ALGEBRA TESTS

   Findings:
   - Dynamical Casimir effect generates entangled photons (2011)
   - Quantum entanglement well-established experimentally
   - No tests specifically probing octonion/quaternion structure
   - Standard quantum mechanics explains all results

6. DIVISION ALGEBRA UNIQUE PREDICTIONS:
   Status: FEW UNIQUE TESTABLE PREDICTIONS

   Predictions by Theory:

   E8 Theory (Lisi):
   - Mirror fermions: NOT DETECTED
   - New gauge bosons: NOT DETECTED
   - Status: Mathematically proven impossible to embed three generations

   G2 Extension (Sedenions):
   - Dark matter candidates from broken G2: NOT DETECTED
   - G2 gauge bosons: NOT DETECTED
   - High-energy deviations from SU(3): NOT OBSERVED

   Exceptional Jordan Algebra (Singh):
   - New U(1) gravitational interaction: NOT TESTED
   - Modified gravity (MOND): OBSERVATIONAL SUPPORT (not unique)
   - Fundamental constant values: EXPLANATORY, not predictive

   Octonion Standard Model (Furey, Todorov):
   - Reproduces Standard Model: CONFIRMED
   - Three generations: CONFIRMED (but not predicted)
   - Charge quantization: CONFIRMED (but not unique)
   - No unique predictions beyond Standard Model

PROPOSED EXPERIMENTAL TESTS (Not Yet Conducted)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. High-Energy Collider Searches:
   - G2 gauge bosons at TeV scale
   - Mirror fermions from E8 breaking
   - New particles from extended symmetries
   - Left-right symmetric partners

   Feasibility: Future colliders (Future Circular Collider ~2070)

2. Precision Tests:
   - Mass ratio predictions (Todorov's Weinberg angle)
   - Yukawa coupling patterns from triality
   - Fundamental constant relationships

   Feasibility: Current precision measurements

3. Gravitational Tests:
   - New U(1) gravitational interaction (Singh)
   - Modified gravity at galactic scales (MOND)
   - Deviations from general relativity

   Feasibility: Astrophysical observations ongoing

4. Quantum Gravity Probes:
   - Non-associative geometry signatures
   - Planck-scale modifications
   - String theory R-flux effects

   Feasibility: Currently impossible, need quantum gravity experiments

5. Dark Matter Searches:
   - G2 dark matter candidates
   - Alternative dark matter from extended symmetries

   Feasibility: Ongoing direct detection experiments

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experimental Status: THEORIES REMAIN UNTESTED

Key Points:
1. Division algebra formulations primarily EXPLANATORY, not PREDICTIVE
2. Most reproduce Standard Model without new physics
3. Few unique predictions distinguishable from Standard Model
4. No experimental program specifically testing these frameworks
5. Remain mathematical curiosities with potential for future physics

Most Testable Predictions:
1. Singh's modified gravity / MOND connection (astrophysical tests)
2. G2 dark matter candidates (direct detection)
3. Mass ratio predictions (precision measurements)
4. Left-right symmetric particles (future colliders)

Least Testable:
1. Non-associative gravity (requires Planck-scale access)
2. 10D spacetime structure (requires extra dimension detection)
3. Octonionic quantum mechanics reformulation
4. Fundamental reformulation of quantum theory
