==================================

CORE PRINCIPLES
---------------
1. SCALAR FIELD FOUNDATIONS
   The Aetheric-Crystalline Framework establishes scalar fields (φ) as fundamental 
   mediators for energy transfer, lattice stabilization, and curvature dynamics within 
   spacetime. These fields modulate interactions between quantum foam and material 
   structures, influencing electromagnetic (EM), thermal, and zero-point energy (ZPE) 
   phenomena.

   Governing Equation:
       □φ + ∂V(φ)/∂φ + κR(t)φ + ζcos(ωt) + ξ(x, t) = 0
