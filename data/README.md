# Dataset Relocated

The equation catalogue CSV exports now live in `meta/datasets/math_science/` so they can be reused across projects and included in the global dataset index.

Files:

- `meta/datasets/math_science/equation_catalog.csv`  
- `meta/datasets/math_science/equation_catalog_preliminary.csv`  
- `meta/datasets/math_science/equation_catalog_pdfs.csv`

Pull new datasets into this folder temporarily only if they are being staged for cleaning; once final, move them into the shared catalogue and update this note.
