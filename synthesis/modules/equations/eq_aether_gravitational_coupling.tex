  S_{\text{coupling}} = \int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi - V(\phi) - \frac{\xi}{2}R\phi^2 - \frac{\zeta}{6M_P^2}R^2\phi^2\right]

% Notes: Action for the Aether scalar field coupled to gravity, including both linear
% and quadratic curvature coupling. The first two terms represent the standard scalar
% field action, the third term is the non-minimal coupling with strength $\xi$ (typically
% $\xi \approx 1/4$ for optimal ZPE coherence), and the fourth term captures higher-order
% quantum corrections with coupling $\zeta$ and Planck mass $M_P$. The $R^2$ term becomes
% important at high curvatures and modifies gravitational wave propagation, black hole
% entropy, and inflationary dynamics. This cross-framework coupling allows the Aether
% scalar to source spacetime curvature and respond to gravitational fields, bridging
% quantum vacuum phenomena with general relativistic gravity.
