\begin{equation}
  F_C = G \frac{m_P^2}{\ell_P^2} = \frac{G(\hbar c / G)}{\hbar G / c^3} = \frac{c^4}{G} = F_*
  \eqtag{U}{GR}{V}

\end{equation}
% Notes: Construction C derives F* from Newton's gravitational force between
% two Planck masses separated by the Planck length.
%
% This is the "self-force" of gravity at the Planck scale---the force required
% to confine a Planck mass within a Planck length.
%
% Physical interpretation: At this scale, spacetime curvature becomes extreme,
% and classical general relativity breaks down. Quantum gravity effects
% dominate.
%
% Numerical verification: All three constructions (A, B, C) agree to better
% than 10⁻¹⁴ relative precision in floating-point arithmetic.
%
% Dependencies: eq:superforce:planck_scale, eq:planck:mass, eq:planck:length
