\section{Phase 4: Cosmological Framework (Summarised)}

Genesis extends its mathematical machinery into a multiverse narrative driven
by nodespace nucleation and origami folding of dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Primordial state:} a high-symmetry fractal equilibrium described
        by a baseline wavefunction $\Psi_{\mathrm{primordial}} = \Psi_{0}\,\ee^{\imag\nu t} F(x)$.
  \item \textbf{Symmetry breaking:} perturbations
        $\delta\Psi = \epsilon \sin(\beta x)$ seed localised nodespaces that
        later unfold into origami dimensions.
  \item \textbf{Nodespace growth:} folded regions expand through energy flux
        cascades, merge via resonant tunnelling, and assemble larger fractal
        hubs forming a scale-free nodespace network.
  \item \textbf{Cosmic synthesis:} the network bridges micro- and macro-scales,
        positing that multiversal structure emerges from repeating math-physical
        motifs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Audit notes.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Equations require dimensional checks and references before inclusion.
  \item Cosmological claims remain speculative; classify as outlook material
        unless corroborated by accepted models or simulations.
  \item Any references to consciousness or anthropic interpretations must be
        clearly labelled as conjecture.
\end{itemize}
