\section{Phase 8: Publication and Integration (Summarised)}

Phase~8 converts the synthesis into actionable deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Canonical documentation:} finalise the LaTeX monograph with verified citations, equations, and appendices.
  \item \textbf{Data and tooling release:} publish scripts, datasets, and figure sources to enable reproducibility.
  \item \textbf{Future research axes:} outline modular extension points (numerical simulations, experimental campaigns, technology pilots).
\end{itemize}

Immediate priorities: finish source normalisation, lock down notation, and run full pipeline builds (data generation $\rightarrow$ figures $\rightarrow$ PDF). Document outstanding speculative elements separately from validated results.
