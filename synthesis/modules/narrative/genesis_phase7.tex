\section{Phase 7: Human Context and Collaboration (Summarised)}

Phase~7 emphasises the sociotechnical aspects of Genesis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cross-disciplinary collaboration:} integrate physics, mathematics, biology, and engineering communities under a shared notation and data framework.
  \item \textbf{Educational outreach:} translate formal results into accessible materials to attract new contributors while maintaining scientific rigour.
  \item \textbf{Ethical considerations:} evaluate potential applications (energy, propulsion, information technologies) within responsible innovation guidelines.
\end{itemize}

Task list: define governance structures for data sharing; establish peer-review checkpoints for speculative claims; harmonise terminology with existing scientific lexicons.
