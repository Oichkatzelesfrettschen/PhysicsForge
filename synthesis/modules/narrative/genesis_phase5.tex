\section{Phase 5: Emergent Complexity and Life (Summarised)}

Genesis Phase~5 frames biological and cognitive emergence as the macro-scale consequence of the preceding fractal dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Self-organising systems:} recursive nodespace interactions are hypothesised to foster stable attractors that correspond to biochemical and ecological structures.
  \item \textbf{Information cascades:} modular symmetries and origami folds are posited to support hierarchical information flows, interpreted as the groundwork for intelligence.
  \item \textbf{Consciousness conjecture:} resonance-based models attempt to link nodespace coherence to awareness; these remain speculative and require rigorous neuroscientific grounding.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outstanding work.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Supply quantitative models that map nodespace dynamics to measurable biological parameters.
  \item Separate philosophical interpretations from testable predictions.
  \item Align terminology with established complexity science and astrobiology literature.
\end{itemize}
