\section*{Opening: The Quantum Magnet that Revealed $E_8$}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2010, a team led by Radu Coldea at Oxford University made a stunning discovery while studying a peculiar quantum magnet made of cobalt-niobate (CoNb$_2$O$_6$). They cooled the crystal to near absolute zero and applied a strong magnetic field transverse to the chain direction. As they swept the field strength, they observed something unprecedented: the ratio of energies between the first two excited states was not some random number, but precisely the golden ratio $\phi = 1.618\ldots$.

This wasn't just numerology. The energy spectrum matched the mass ratios of particles predicted by a quantum field theory with $E_8$ symmetry---an exceptional Lie group living in 8 dimensions with 248 generators and 240 roots. The same mathematical structure that string theorists had been studying for decades in the context of heterotic strings and Grand Unified Theories was now appearing in a tabletop experiment at 0.04 Kelvin.
