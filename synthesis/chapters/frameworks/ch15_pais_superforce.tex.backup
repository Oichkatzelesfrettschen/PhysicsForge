\chapter{The Pais Superforce Theory}
\label{ch:pais_superforce}

This chapter provides an overview of the Superforce theory as proposed by Salvatore Cezar Pais in his 2023 paper, "SUPERFORCE – the Fundamental Force of Unification".

\section{Key Concepts}

The theory introduces the concept of the "Superforce," identified as the Planck Force (c⁴/G), as the fundamental force of unification. The Superforce is proposed to bridge the gap between General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), offering a path to a theory of Quantum Gravity.

The key tenets of the theory are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Superforce unifies the four fundamental forces at the Planck scale.
    \item The Superforce acts on the local spacetime geometric structure to create Energy Density, and therefore Matter.
    \item The Superforce can be engineered by manipulating the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of a medium.
    \item The cosmos may be filled with a superfluid-like 'substance' as a result of the Superforce's action.
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Equations}

The theory is supported by several key equations, which are presented in the following sections.

\section{Commentary and Extensions}

A 2023 presentation by John Brandenburg provides further commentary and extension of the Pais Superforce theory, connecting it to the theory of Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM).

\subsection{GEM Theory Connection}

Brandenburg provides a GEM expression for the Pais Superforce, and introduces the GEM Vacuum Bernoulli Equation for gravity control.

\subsection{Speculative Applications}

The presentation speculates on the utilization of EM fields for "anti-gravity" lifting forces and inertia reduction, referencing a Pais patent.
