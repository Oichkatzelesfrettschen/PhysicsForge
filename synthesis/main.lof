\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces GPS satellite system as a practical demonstration of General Relativity. Earth's mass warps spacetime (shown by curved grid), causing gravitational time dilation: satellite clocks run faster by 45.9 $\mu $s/day in weaker gravity at orbital altitude. Orbital velocity contributes a special relativistic effect (clocks run slower by 7.2 $\mu $s/day). The net correction of +38.7 $\mu $s/day is critical---without GR-based adjustments, GPS positioning would accumulate 11 km of error daily. Orange arrows show signal paths from four satellites to ground receiver. This motivates the mathematical framework developed in Chapter 1: tensor calculus and differential geometry are not abstract formalism but essential tools for technologies we use daily.}}{6}{figure.caption.7}%

Each blue dot represents a root vector; shells of increasing radius show the hierarchical organization. The E8 lattice appears in string theory compactifications and provides geometric foundations for grand unification theories. Note: This is a schematic representation; actual root positions involve irrational coordinates in higher dimensions.}}{49}{figure.caption.40}%
