### 2. Critical Bug Fixes
[OK] **Fixed** `test_extraction_smoke.py` UnboundLocalError
- Issue: Variable 'sample' was out of scope due to incorrect indentation
- Resolution: Fixed indentation to make variable accessible
- Verification: Smoke test now passes successfully

### 3. Repository Harmonization
[OK] **Updated** `.gitignore` to exclude audit log files
[OK] **Updated** `CLAUDE.md` to reflect cross-platform support
[OK] **Verified** `.gitattributes` for line ending consistency
[OK] **Generated** validation and audit reports

### 4. Quality Checks
[OK] Smoke test: PASSING
[OK] Catalog validation: 1412 equations validated
[OK] Repository structure: Sound and well-organized
[OK] Documentation: Comprehensive and current

### 5. Git Commits
```
cb9af50 Repository audit, harmonization, and preparation for publication
d9c5d59 Initial commit: Unified Field Theory synthesis with superforce validation
```

## Current Repository State

### File Changes (Committed)
- [OK] COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md (NEW): Full audit and harmonization plan
- [OK] VALIDATION_REPORT.md (NEW): Catalog validation results
- [OK] REPO_AUDIT.md (UPDATED): Repository structure analysis
- [OK] scripts/test_extraction_smoke.py (FIXED): Bug fix
- [OK] .gitignore (UPDATED): Added audit log exclusion
- [OK] CLAUDE.md (UPDATED): Platform information updated
- [OK] data/fixtures/smoke_equations.csv (REGENERATED): From fixed test

### Untracked Files (Safe to Ignore)
- data/fixtures/sample_doc.md (test fixture, auto-generated)

### Git Status
```
On branch main
Untracked files:
  data/fixtures/sample_doc.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present
```

**Note**: The untracked file is safe to leave untracked - it's auto-generated by the smoke test.

## GitHub Push Steps

The repository remote is already configured but the GitHub repository doesn't exist yet. You need to create it on GitHub first.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `PhysicsForge`
3. Description: "Unified Field Theory synthesis integrating Aether, Genesis, and Pais frameworks with rigorous mathematics"
4. Visibility: Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** add license (we already have LICENSE)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Verify Remote

The remote is already configured:
```bash
git remote -v
# Expected output:
# origin git@github.com:EchoCog/PhysicsForge.git (fetch)
# origin git@github.com:EchoCog/PhysicsForge.git (push)
```

If you need to change the remote or organization name:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/PhysicsForge.git
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If this is your first push, GitHub will ask you to authenticate. Use one of:
- SSH key (recommended - already configured if remote uses `git@github.com`)
- Personal Access Token (PAT) via HTTPS
- GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)

### Step 4: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/EchoCog/PhysicsForge (or your username)
2. Verify all files are present
3. Check README.md renders correctly
4. Verify commit history shows both commits

---

## Post-Push Recommendations

### Immediate (First Hour)
1. [OK] Verify repository on GitHub
2. [OK] Update repository description and topics
3. [OK] Add repository topics: `physics`, `mathematics`, `unified-field-theory`, `latex`, `python`
4. [OK] Star your own repository (for visibility)
5. [OK] Create first GitHub Release (v1.0.0)

### First Week
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI
2. Enable GitHub Pages (optional)
3. Create CONTRIBUTING guide update
4. Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
5. Set up branch protection rules for main

### Ongoing
1. Address catalog parity gaps (34,849 equations without modules)
2. Continue Phase 2-5 chapter development
3. Increase module utilization from 60% to 85%+
4. Expand test coverage
5. Improve cross-platform compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Solution**: Create the GitHub repository first (see Step 1 above)

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check SSH key
ssh -T git@github.com

# If fails, add SSH key to GitHub:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy output and add to https://github.com/settings/keys
```

### Issue: "Failed to push some refs"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Pull first (if repository has any commits)
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Line ending warnings
**Response**: These are expected and safe. Git will automatically normalize line endings on commit. The warnings will disappear after the first push.
