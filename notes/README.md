# Notes Directory Overview

This directory contains working documents, drafts, and synthesis summaries related to the Math & Science Research Hub project. It is organized into the following subdirectories:

*   `frameworks/`: Contains detailed notes and drafts for the Aether, Genesis, and Pais frameworks.
*   `misc/`: Miscellaneous notes and temporary files.
*   `project_management/`: Project planning, status reports, and audit archives.
*   `references/`: Modularized mathematical reference material.
*   `research_surveys/`: Consolidated research surveys and literature reviews.
*   `synthesis/`: Drafts and working documents related to the LaTeX synthesis process.

## File Naming Conventions

*   Framework files: `[framework_name]_v[version_number]_[descriptor].md` (e.g., `aether_v001_06_comprehensive.md`)
*   Project management files: `[TOPIC]_ARCHIVE.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
*   Reference files: `[topic]_reference.md`
*   Survey files: `[Topic]_[Type]_[TimePeriod].md`

## Version Lineage Documentation

Metadata headers are used in framework and survey files to track their lineage, status, and transformation into synthesis chapters.
