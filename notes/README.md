# Notes Directory Overview

This directory contains working documents, drafts, and synthesis summaries related to the Math & Science Research Hub project. It is organized into the following subdirectories:

*   `frameworks/`: This directory was intended to contain detailed notes and drafts for the Aether, Genesis, and Pais frameworks. However, the specific subdirectories and files for these frameworks could not be located, suggesting they may have been moved or deleted in a prior phase.
*   `misc/`: Miscellaneous notes and temporary files.
*   `project_management/`: Project planning, status reports, and audit archives.
*   `references/`: Modularized mathematical reference material.
*   `synthesis/`: Drafts and working documents related to the LaTeX synthesis process.

## File Naming Conventions

*   Project management files: `[TOPIC]_ARCHIVE.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
*   Reference files: `[topic]_reference.md`

## Version Lineage Documentation

Metadata headers were intended to be used in framework and survey files to track their lineage, status, and transformation into synthesis chapters. However, the framework and survey files themselves could not be located.

## Quick Reference for Finding Content

*   **Framework details**: The specific framework files could not be located.
*   **Project status**: See `notes/project_management/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
*   **Mathematical references**: See `notes/references/`
