# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

---

## Executive Summary (from PHASE_3D_STATUS_REPORT.md - 2025-10-23)

Phase 3D has successfully created the foundational unified synthesis chapters (Ch17-18), establishing the theoretical framework for complete unification.

### Completion Status:
- **Completed**: Chapters 17-18 (1,826 lines, 18 equation modules)
- **Remaining**: Chapters 19-21 (~3,000 lines, ~25 equation modules)
- **Overall Progress**: 38% complete (by line count for Unified Synthesis)

## Simulation Quality Assessment (from PYTHON_SIMULATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md - 2025-10-19)

**Overall Assessment: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5 stars)**

The current `generate_data.py` contains **toy simulations** suitable for **visualization demonstrations** but **NOT suitable for scientific claims** without major enhancements.

### Critical Finding:
The simulations are "plotting equations" NOT "running experiments." They lack empirical validation, uncertainty quantification, proper numerical methods, and statistical rigor.

### Verdict: NOT READY FOR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION

## Next Steps

*   **Unified Framework Synthesis**: Complete Chapters 19-21 (Master Equation, Cosmological Applications, Quantum Gravity). Chapter 19 (Master Equation) is the highest priority.
*   **Simulation Refinement**: Address critical deficiencies in `generate_data.py` as outlined in the Python Simulation Audit Report.
