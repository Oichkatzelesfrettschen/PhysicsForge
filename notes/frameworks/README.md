# Frameworks Directory Overview

This directory was intended to contain detailed notes and drafts for the Aether, Genesis, and Pais frameworks. These files were meant to serve as the primary source material for the LaTeX chapters in the `synthesis/` directory.

## Status Update

The specific framework files and their subdirectories (e.g., `aether/`, `genesis/`, `pais/`) could not be located within this directory or elsewhere in the project. This suggests that these files may have been moved, deleted, or consolidated in a prior, unrecorded phase of the project.

Therefore, the sections below regarding "Framework Version History," "Transformation Status," and "Citation of Primary Sources" are based on the original intent of this directory, but the files they refer to are currently missing.

## Framework Version History (Original Intent)

Each framework file was intended to include a metadata header with version information, date, and status to track the evolution of each framework's documentation.

## Transformation Status (MD -> Synthesis) (Original Intent)

Files marked with `Status: transformed` and `Transformed-To: synthesis/chapters/[chapter range]` were intended to indicate that their content had been integrated into the main LaTeX monograph.

## Citation of Primary Sources (Original Intent)

Original source documents and their relevant sections were intended to be cited within the metadata headers and in the content of the framework files.
