# Frameworks Directory Overview

This directory contains detailed notes and drafts for the Aether, Genesis, and Pais frameworks. These files serve as the primary source material for the LaTeX chapters in the `synthesis/` directory.

## Framework Version History

Each framework file includes a metadata header with version information, date, and status. This helps track the evolution of each framework's documentation.

## Transformation Status (MD -> Synthesis)

Files marked with `Status: transformed` and `Transformed-To: synthesis/chapters/[chapter range]` indicate that their content has been integrated into the main LaTeX monograph.

## Citation of Primary Sources

Original source documents and their relevant sections are cited within the metadata headers and in the content of the framework files.
