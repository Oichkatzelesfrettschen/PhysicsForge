# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical files, legacy scripts, and obsolete documentation that are preserved for reference but are no longer actively used in the repository.

## Directory Structure

- **legacy_scripts/**: Scripts that have been superseded or integrated into the main `scripts/` directory
- **historical_docs/**: Documentation files that are no longer current but preserved for historical context
- **build_artifacts/**: Temporary or one-time build artifacts from repository migrations

## Guidelines

Files in this directory are:
- Not part of the active build or test pipeline
- Preserved for historical reference and context
- May contain outdated information or deprecated functionality
- Should not be modified unless for archival purposes

If you need to resurrect any functionality, copy the file to the appropriate active directory and update it to current standards.
